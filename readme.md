Guardian Management
===================

In order to simplify their management, Guardian web-apps should conform to our [web applications specification]
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ckZC0fGtilntcsJy6mBUylvohLoxUKjkwGDaur-pE8/edit). 
This library provides standard management pages and makes it easy to create new 
app-specific ones in order to fulfill those criteria. 

The library is  intended to be web framework agnostic and currently has support for 
anything using the servlet API, the Play framework and as a standalone internal server
running on a separate port. A small adapter library
for the request and response abstractions, blatantly inspired by/ripped off from 
[lift](http://www.liftweb.net), needs to be added to support other frameworks.



Getting Started (Servlet API)
===============

Add the dependency to your build
-----------------------------------

In your build.sbt:

    resolvers += "Guardian Github Snapshots" at "http://guardian.github.com/maven/repo-releases"
    libraryDependencies += "com.gu" %% "management-servlet-api" % "5.17"

As of 5.7, Scala 2.8.1 and 2.9.0-1 are no longer supported. Upgrade your project
to Scala 2.9.1.

Add the management filter to your web.xml
--------------------------------------------

To avoid any conflict with your choice of web framework, the managment
pages are implemented as a filter. So, for example:

    <!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC
            "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
            "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd" >

    <web-app>

        <filter>
            <filter-name>managementFilter</filter-name>
            <filter-class>com.gu.management.example.MyAppManagementFilter</filter-class>
        </filter>

        <filter-mapping>
            <filter-name>managementFilter</filter-name>
            <url-pattern>/management/*</url-pattern>
        </filter-mapping>

    </web-app>

The filter-class is a class that you are going to implement.

Implement the filter class
-----------------------------

Your filter class should derive from `com.gu.management.ManagementFilter` and implement
the pages member:

    class MyAppManagementFilter extends ManagementFilter {
      val applicationName = "My Application Name"
      lazy val pages =
        new DummyPage() ::
        new ManifestPage() ::
        new Switchboard(applicationName, Switches.all) ::
        new StatusPage(applicationName, TimingMetrics.all) ::
        Nil
    }

Even for mostly java projects, you'll need to write your management pages in scala. However,
things like timing metrics and switches have a java-friendly interface and are usable from java.

Look at the example!
-----------------------

The [example project](https://github.com/guardian/guardian-management/tree/master/example-servlet-api) has
a filter set up and uses some switches and timing metrics from both scala and java.

    $ git clone git@github.com:guardian/guardian-management.git
    $ cd guardian-management
    $ ./sbt010
    > project example-servlet-api
    > container:start

Try the following URLs locally:

 * http://localhost:8080/java-app
 * http://localhost:8080/scala-app
 * http://localhost:8080/management
 * http://localhost:8080/management/switchboard

Also, enable the `take-it-down` switch and retry `/scala-app` and `/java-app`.

The application also has very simple custom management page, but the best thing to do if you want to write your
own management pages is to look at how the pre-defined ones are implemented: a simple readonly page to look at is
the
[status page](https://github.com/guardian/guardian-management/blob/master/management/src/main/scala/com/gu/management/StatusPage.scala),
and a more complex page that supports POSTs is
[the switchboard](https://github.com/guardian/guardian-management/blob/master/management/src/main/scala/com/gu/management/switchables.scala).



Getting Started (Play Framework)
===============

Add the dependency to your build
-----------------------------------

In your build.sbt for sbt 0.10:

    resolvers += "Guardian Github Snapshots" at "http://guardian.github.com/maven/repo-releases"
    libraryDependencies += "com.gu" %% "management-play" % "5.17"

As of 5.7, Scala 2.8.1 and 2.9.0-1 are no longer supported. Upgrade your project
to Scala 2.9.1.

Add the management controller to your routes
--------------------------------------------

Hook in the management URLs to your Play `conf/routes` file using the following:

    GET     /management$path<.*>        controllers.Management.apply(path)
    POST    /management$path<.*>        controllers.Management.apply(path)

Implement the management controller
-----------------------------------

In `app/controllers/Management.scala` add the controller definition with the desired management
pages:

    object Management extends ManagementController {
      val applicationName = "My application name"
      lazy val pages =
        new DummyPage() ::
        new ManifestPage() ::
        new Switchboard(applicationName, Switches.all) ::
        new StatusPage(applicationName, TimingMetrics.all) ::
        Nil
    }

Look at the example!
-----------------------

The [example project](https://github.com/guardian/guardian-management/tree/master/example-play) has
management routes set up and uses some switches and timing metrics.

    $ git clone git@github.com:guardian/guardian-management.git
    $ cd guardian-management
    $ ./sbt010
    > project example-play
    > run

Try the following URLs locally:

 * http://localhost:9000/scala-app
 * http://localhost:9000/management
 * http://localhost:9000/management/switchboard

Also, enable the `take-it-down` switch and retry `/scala-app`.

The application also has very simple custom management page, but the best thing to do if you want to write your
own management pages is to look at how the pre-defined ones are implemented: a simple readonly page to look at is
the
[status page](https://github.com/guardian/guardian-management/blob/master/management/src/main/scala/com/gu/management/StatusPage.scala),
and a more complex page that supports POSTs is
[the switchboard](https://github.com/guardian/guardian-management/blob/master/management/src/main/scala/com/gu/management/switchables.scala).


Getting started (standalone)
============================

The management-internal shim allows the management libraries to run separate of any container or framework, on a second
port, making use of an internally implemented HTTP server.

The library will use the first port that it can bind to from 18080 to 18099 and, if permissions allow it will write
a file out to /var/run/ports/<name>.port containing the number of the port that it has bound to.

Add the dependency to your build
--------------------------------

In your build.sbt for sbt 0.10:

    resolvers += "Guardian Github Snapshots" at "http://guardian.github.com/maven/repo-releases"
    libraryDependencies += "com.gu" %% "management-internal" % "5.17"

Implement a handler
-------------------

Implement the ManagementHandler variable applicationName and pages.  The latter should contain
the list of pages for your application - see above.

```scala
val handler = new ManagementHandler {
    val applicationName = "my-application-name"
    def pages = List(
        new ManifestPage(),
        new Switchboard(applicationName, Switches.all),
        new StatusPage(applicationName,TimingMetrics.all)
    )
}
```

Start and stop the internal server
----------------------------------

You should call ManagementServer.start and ManagementServer.shutdown at appropriate points
in your application.

```scala
// bind the port and try to write the port number out to file
ManagementServer.start(handler)
```

```scala
// shutdown to unregister the port binding properly
ManagementServer.shutdown()
```

Using the internal server in Play 2
===================================

Configure your dependencies
---------------------------

    resolvers += "Guardian Github Snapshots" at "http://guardian.github.com/maven/repo-releases"
    libraryDependencies += "com.gu" %% "management-play" % "5.17"

Add to the play plugins file
----------------------------

Add the following line to conf/play.plugins (create it if it doesn't exist):

    1000:com.gu.management.play.InternalManagementPlugin

Bind the management pages
-------------------------

The plugin locates the pages and application name by convention.

Create a scala Object called conf.Management that mixes in the ManagementPageManifest trait to
provide the list of pages and your application name to the plugin:

```scala
package conf

object Management extends ManagementPageManifest {
  val applicationName = "your-application-name"

  lazy val pages = List(
    new ManifestPage,
    new HealthcheckManagementPage,
    new Switchboard(applicationName, Switches.all),
    StatusPage(applicationName, Metrics.all),
    new LogbackLevelPage(applicationName)
  )
}
```

If there is a reason you can't name your file conf.Management, you can override it
by setting management.manifestobject in application.conf.


Providing metrics for GANGLIA
=====================
Since version 5, guardian-management has been designed to allow application to simply provide metrics for consumption by the [Ganglia monitoring system](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/). 

 * Metrics are presented by a StatusPage object, the name of which should be the name of your app:

`new StatusPage("My App Name", Metrics.....)`

So for example identity has 2 status pages:

`new StatusPage("identity-webapp", Metrics.....)`
`new StatusPage("identity-api", Metrics.....)`

 * There are three types of metric currently supported:

   * Timing: standard timing metric, takes number of events over a time period. Also provides a count of those events.
   * Count: Constantly incrementing counter.
   * Gauge: Count at a particular point in time.

 * Creating A Metric

You need to provide four arguments, with an optional fifth.

`new TimingMetic("group", "name", "title", "description")`

    GROUP: this is used as a logical grouping. Think of it as a noun. For example "emails"
    NAME: This is a verb related to the noun defined in group. For example "sent"
    TITLE: This is a text string used to title the graphs. Keep it short. For example "Emails Sent"
    DESCRIPTION: This is a longer description of the metric. Used on the hover over.
    For example "Total number of emails sent"

Group and Name are munged together in ganglia to give the actual name used on the console.
There is another console in Graphite (graphing tool) which will allow subdivision on group.
Allowing you to see all the "emails" metrics and to create mash ups of all of these.
Using the groups as it's top level option.

As a rule use underscores (_) not hyphens (-) as delimiters.

So in scala:

`object SuccessfulEmails extends CountMetric("emails", "sent", "Emails Sent", "Number of emails sent")`

The fifth metric is the field master. This takes Option[Metric] with a default of None.
This is used to indicate that the metric you are creating is a child of a
another metric. The parameter is the metric you wish to be a child of

For example. Imagine there is a time taken for a request metric:

`object Requests extends TimingMetric("requests", "api", "Api Requests Timer", "Total number and time taken for API request")`

You may have a mongoDB requests metric, which is a child of the overall HTTP request:

`object MongoRequests extends TimingMetric("requests", "mongodb", "Mongodb Requests", "Mongo request timer", Some(Requests))`

This allows Ganglia to give the proportion of time of the HTTP request taken talking to mongo. You could have another:

`object MongoRequests extends TimingMetric("requests", "oracle", "Oracle Requests", "Oracle request timer", Some(Requests))`

Ganglia would now be able to show you propertions of each DB request as a proportion of total HTTP time.
